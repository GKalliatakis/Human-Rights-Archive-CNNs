"""Leverage a pre-trained network (saved network previously trained on a large dataset)
in order to build an image recognition system and classify human rights violations.

Transfer image representations from popular deep learning models using the (original 9 classes) HRA dataset:

[A] ConvNet as fixed feature extractor.`Feature extraction` will simply consist of taking the convolutional base
of a previously-trained network, running the new data through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output.
(i.e. train only the randomly initialized top layers while freezing all convolutional layers of the original model).

[B] `Fine-tuning`, consists in unfreezing a few of the top layers (in our case, unfreeze the 2 lower convolutional layers)
of a frozen model base used for feature extraction,
and jointly training both the newly added part of the model (in our case, the fully-connected classifier) and these top layers.

Doing both, in that order, will ensure a more stable and consistent training.
This is because the large gradient updates triggered by randomly initialized weights could wreck
the learned weights in the convolutional base if not frozen.
Once the last layer has stabilized (transfer learning), then we move onto retraining more layers (fine-tuning).

[1] In order to perform fine-tuning, all layers should start with properly trained weights:
for instance you should not slap a randomly initialized fully-connected network on
top of a pre-trained convolutional base. This is because the large gradient updates triggered
by the randomly initialized weights would wreck the learned weights in the convolutional base.
In our case this is why we first train the top-level classifier, and only then start fine-tuning convolutional weights alongside it.

[2] We choose to only fine-tune the last convolutional block rather than the entire network
in order to prevent overfitting, since the entire network would have a very large entropic capacity and
thus a strong tendency to overfit. The features learned by low-level convolutional blocks are more general,
less abstract than those found higher-up, so it is sensible to keep the first
few blocks fixed (more general features) and only fine-tune the last one (more specialized features).

[3] Fine-tuning should be done with a very slow learning rate, and typically with the SGD optimizer
rather than an adaptative learning rate optimizer such as RMSProp. This is to make sure that the
magnitude of the updates stays very small, so as not to wreck the previously learned features.

# Creating your class_weight dictionary:
# 1. determine the ratio of reference_class/other_class. If you choose class_0 as your reference,
# you'll have (1000/1000, 1000/500, 1000/100) = (1,2,10)
